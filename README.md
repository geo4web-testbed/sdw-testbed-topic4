# Spatial data on the Web Testbed; topic 4

This repository is a placeholder for project management around developments in topic4 of the [spatial-data-on-the-web testbed](http://www.geonovum.nl/onderwerp-artikel/testbed-locatie-data-het-web), organised by Geonovum.

Topic 4 deals with "Spatial data on the web using the current SDI". In the scope of this topic we'll create and improve existing software that facilitates access of traditional SDI (OGC:WFS/OGC:CSW) by popular API's, such as Schema.org crawling, Semantic web & Api's.

Check out the [issues](../../issues) or [wiki](../../wiki) for further info.
