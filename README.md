# Spatial data on the Web Testbed; topic 4

This repository is used for slides and documents from research topic4 of the [spatial-data-on-the-web testbed](http://www.geonovum.nl/onderwerp-artikel/testbed-locatie-data-het-web), organised by Geonovum.

Topic 4 deals with "Spatial data on the web using the current SDI". In the scope of this topic we have created new and improved existing software that facilitates access to spatial data infrastructure components (OGC WFS/OGC CSW) by search engines using HTML with annotations using the schema.org vocabulary, support for JSON-LD, links to other resources, and more. 

The originally planned work is described in the [proposal](Proposal_topic_4_ii_GeoCat_LDF.pdf). The implementation and the findings are documented in the [report](http://geo4web-testbed.github.io/topic4/). Note that this version of the report includes some fixes compared to the original [PDF report](spatial-data-on-the-web-using-sdi-report.pdf).
